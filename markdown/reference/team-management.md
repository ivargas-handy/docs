##Team Management


With the Sauce Team Management feature you can easily create and manage group or individual accounts within your organization, allowing everyone to test from the same batch of usage minutes under a single plan.

##Team Management Plans


Sauce Labs offers both Enterprise and Subscription plans that provide you with different numbers of concurrent VMs, concurrent devices, and minutes to meet your specific testing needs. Enterprise plans are invoiced on a monthly basis, while Subscription plans will charge your credit card on a monthly basis for your current plan level.

### How Your Plan Minutes Are Used

Individual accounts within a team utilize the minutes from the root parent account. This way, all team members are able to use the same pool of minutes even if they are spread across different teams. Usage allocation for subaccounts is tied to the master account settings: if the main account is set to disallow tests when out of minutes, the subaccount will also be unable to run tests when the main account runs out of minutes. If the master account is set to run into overages once the set number of minutes has been exceeded, the subaccount will also run into overages.

Access Configuration
--------------------

On your Team Management page, you can configure the saucelabs.com domain for your organization, require that all users in your organization use Sauce Connect, and enable Single Sign-On (SSO) to manage user creation and authentication.

### Using Sauce Team Management Features to to Secure Access to Your Domain

Sauce offers several features that, when used together, create a very tight system to secure access to your domain.

1.  Setting a domain for your organization provides a single URL for distribution for your team to access Sauce, and is required for enabling access to Sauce through single sign-on (SSO).
2.  [Requiring SSO](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/single-sign-on/) ensures that the only way someone can access your domain is if their identity has already been validated through your own authentication system.
3.  Requiring the use of Sauce Connect ensures that the only access to your applications and tests is from sandboxed sessions that originate from specific Sauce Labs machines.

### Setting Your Domain

Your domain is used to configure settings such as a secure subdomain address and Single Sign-On (SSO) usernames. For example, if you entered a domain name of `acme`, it would create the subdomain `acme.protected.saucelabs.com`, and an SSO prefix of `sso:acme:mysampleusername`.

1.  Click your account menu.
2.  Click **Team Management**.
3.  At the top of the page, click the edit icon next to the domain name to edit it.

### Requiring Sauce Connect for Your Domain

You can require that all users in your domain use Sauce Connect for testing. Sauce Connect uses a secure tunnel protocol that gives specific Sauce machines access to your local network. Sauce Connect sessions are sandboxed from outside data flows, and are a convenient way to securely test apps that aren't ready for public deployment. See [the Sauce Connect documentation](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/sauce-connect/) for more information.

1.  Click your account menu.
2.  Click **Team Management**.
3.  Under the **Sauce Connect** heading, click **Configure** to set up Sauce Connect.

Managing Users for Your Plan
----------------------------

### Viewing Users Associated with Your Account

You can view the users associated with your account on the **Team Management** page.

1.  Click your account menu.
2.  Click **Team Management**.
3.  At the bottom of the **Team Management** page you will see a list of all user accounts associated with your account. If there are additional subaccounts associated with those accounts as their parents, you will see an indicator of how many users are associated with those subaccounts. Click the expand arrow next to the number indicator to view those subaccounts. The account listings also include the concurrency allocation for each account, and the account type.

### Adding Users

You can add users, set their concurrency limit, and associate them with a parent account on the **Team Management** page. You have the option to invite users, in which case they set their own user name and password, or you can set the username and password yourself.

1.  Click your account menu.
2.  Click **Team Management**.
3.  At the bottom of the page, next to **Users**, click **Add User**.
4.  Enter a **Username** and **Password** for the user, along with an optional **First Name** and **Last Name**.
5.  If you've configured Single Sign On (SSO) for your domain, select **SSO User** and usernames and passwords will be automatically generated by your identity provider.
6.  Under **Concurrency Limit**, enter the number of **VMs** you want to allocate to the user
7.  Select **Admin** if you want the user to be able to manage concurrency allocations for their peers and sub accounts.
    If you want users associated with your account to also be able to add users, you need to select this option under **Access Settings**, as explained in **Managing Access Settings for All Users**.
8.  Click **Done**.
    If you want to continue adding users, select **Continue Creating Users** and then click **Done**.

**Note: Concurrency Allocations and Parent Accounts**

The number of VMs you can allocate to a user is based on the total number of VMs that are allocated to the Parent account you associate with the user. For example, if the parent account has an allocation of 200 VMs and 25 devices, you could allocate 200 VMs and 25 devices to each subaccount.

**Note: Inviting Users by Email**

If you want to invite a user by email and allow them to set their own username and password, enter their email address and click **Invite.**

If you invite a user by email, you will need to wait until they accept your invitation before you can edit the concurrency settings for their account and associate them with other accounts.
